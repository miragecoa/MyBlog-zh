Research & Project Experience
=============================
**Open FinLLM Leaderboard** - Collaboration with FINOS Foundation
- **Position**: Project Leader
- **Duration**: 2024 - Present
- **Project Description**: A large-scale financial language model evaluation and benchmarking project in collaboration with FINOS Foundation, aimed at evaluating LLMs' multimodal capabilities in financial tasks and exploring FinAgents use cases.
- **Project Vision**:
  - Provide specialized evaluation framework for financial language models
  - Conduct comprehensive benchmarking of 30 LLMs across about 50 financial tasks
  - Help researchers and practitioners identify the right model for financial applications
- **Core Features**:
  - **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Detailed assessment across seven key financial categories
  - **Real-World Relevance**: Benchmarks based on actual financial industry challenges
  - **Zero-Shot Testing**: Evaluation of models' ability to generalize to unseen financial tasks
  - **Transparent Metrics**: Clear performance metrics for informed model selection
- **Technical Highlights**:
  - Financial Question Tree Structure: Hierarchical organization of 100,000 financial questions
  - Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP): Protect dataset privacy and prevent leaderboard manipulation
  - FinAgents Demos: Showcase applications of financial LLMs in real-world scenarios
- **Project Impact**: This project will evolve into a larger Evaluation and Benchmarking Suite

**Analyzing Cascading GME Event Using LLM** - Troy, NY
- **Position**: Research Assistant
- **Supervisor**: Professor Xiaoyang Liu, RPI
- **Duration**: Oct 2023 - Aug 2024
- **Project Description**: This project uses Large Language Models to analyze the cascading GME (GameStop) event, predicting and understanding social media-driven financial market volatility by analyzing WallStreetBets user behavior patterns.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Deployed Scrapy to collect GME-related user posts and discussions from WallStreetBets
  - Used OpenAI API and locally deployed llama2 for text sentiment analysis
  - Established correlation models between social media sentiment and financial market volatility
  - Analyzed sentiment tendencies and investment intentions in user posts
  - Applied MySQL for storing user posts and analysis results

**Handwritten Digits Data** - Fall 2023
