Open FinLLM Leaderboard Project
================================

## Project Overview

The Open FinLLM Leaderboard is a large-scale financial language model evaluation and benchmarking project in collaboration with FINOS Foundation. As the Project Leader, I am responsible for leading the development of this comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' multimodal capabilities in financial tasks and explores FinAgents use cases.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to establish a standardized evaluation framework for financial language models that:

- **Provides Specialized Evaluation**: Offers domain-specific assessment for financial LLMs
- **Comprehensive Benchmarking**: Evaluates 30 LLMs across approximately 50 financial tasks
- **Guides Model Selection**: Helps researchers and practitioners identify the right model for financial applications
- **Promotes Industry Standards**: Establishes benchmarks for financial AI technology

## Core Features

### 1. Comprehensive Evaluation
- **Seven Key Categories**: Detailed assessment across major financial domains
- **Real-World Relevance**: Benchmarks based on actual financial industry challenges
- **Zero-Shot Testing**: Evaluation of models' ability to generalize to unseen financial tasks
- **Transparent Metrics**: Clear performance metrics for informed model selection

### 2. Financial Question Tree Structure
Our hierarchical organization of 100,000 financial questions follows a three-level structure:

1. **Top Level - Financial Domains (7 categories)**
   - Major financial domains and applications

2. **Middle Level - Question Types (50 types)**
   - Examples include:
     - Financial QA
     - SEC Filing Analysis
     - Financial Statement Analysis
     - Market Analysis
     - Risk Assessment

3. **Bottom Level - Individual Questions (100 examples)**

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)
Our Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) implementation ensures evaluation integrity while protecting sensitive data:

- **Privacy-Preserving of Datasets**: Models can prove their performance without exposing training data
- **Anti-Gaming Protection**: Prevents leaderboard manipulation through cryptographic verification
- **Data Confidentiality**: Financial institutions can contribute proprietary datasets without disclosure
- **Transparent Auditing**: All evaluations are cryptographically verifiable while maintaining privacy

### 4. FinAgents Demos
The FinAgents Demos shows applications of financial LLMs in real-world scenarios. Each demo represents a specific use case where AI can enhance financial operations and decision-making.

**Search Agent**
- Real-time document analysis
- Multi-source information analysis

**Tutor Agent**
- Personalized financial education
- 24/7 learning support

**Trading Agent**
- Real-time market analysis
- Trading strategy generation
- Risk assessment and management

**XBRL Agent**
- Financial statement analysis
- XBRL data extraction and validation

## Project Impact
