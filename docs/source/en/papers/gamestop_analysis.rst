Abstract
--------

This paper proposes a practical approach using network analysis and large language models to analyze the cascading outbreak of the GameStop event. The GameStop event was an unprecedented financial market phenomenon that occurred in early 2021, primarily driven by Reddit's WallStreetBets community, leading to dramatic fluctuations in stock prices.

Our research combines network analysis techniques and large language models to deeply analyze how social media user behavior affects financial markets. By constructing user interaction networks, we identify key influencers and information propagation patterns. Meanwhile, we use large language models to analyze the sentiment tendencies and investment intentions in user posts, establishing correlation models between social media sentiment and stock price movements.

This approach not only helps us understand the propagation mechanisms of the GameStop event but also provides a new analytical framework for analyzing similar social media-driven financial market phenomena.

Research Background
-------------------

The GameStop event in early 2021 was a significant event in financial market history, demonstrating how social media can influence traditional financial markets. This event began with Reddit's WallStreetBets community, where users collectively acted against Wall Street short-selling institutions, causing GameStop stock prices to surge by thousands of percentage points in a short period.

This event triggered deep reflection in academia and industry about the relationship between social media and financial markets. Traditional financial analysis methods primarily focus on fundamental and technical indicators, while neglecting the impact of collective social media user behavior on markets. Therefore, we need new analytical methods to understand and predict such social media-driven financial market phenomena.
