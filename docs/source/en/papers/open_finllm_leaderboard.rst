Abstract
--------

Financial large language models (FinLLMs) with multimodal capabilities are envisioned to revolutionize applications across business, finance, accounting, and auditing. However, real-world adoption requires robust benchmarks of FinLLMs' and FinAgents' performance. Maintaining an open leaderboard is crucial for encouraging innovative adoption and improving model effectiveness.

In collaboration with Linux Foundation and Hugging Face, we create an open FinLLM leaderboard, which serves as an open platform for assessing and comparing AI models' performance on a wide spectrum of financial tasks. By democratizing access to advances of financial knowledge and intelligence, a chatbot or agent may enhance the analytical capabilities of the general public to a professional level within a few months of usage.

This open leaderboard welcomes contributions from academia, open-source community, industry, and stakeholders. In particular, we encourage contributions of new datasets, tasks, and models for continual update. Through fostering a collaborative and open ecosystem, we seek to promote financial AI readiness.

Research Background
-------------------

With the rapid development of large language model technology, the financial AI field faces the following challenges:

1. **Lack of Standardized Evaluation**: Existing financial AI model evaluations lack unified standards and benchmarks
2. **Limited Evaluation Scope**: Most evaluations focus only on single tasks or single modalities
3. **Closed Nature**: Many evaluation platforms lack openness and transparency
4. **Insufficient Practicality**: Evaluation results have gaps with actual application scenarios

To address these issues, we proposed the Open FinLLM Leaderboard project.
